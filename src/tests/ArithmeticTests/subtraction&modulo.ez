make a = 5;
make b = 10;
make c = a-b;
print c; #c = -5

make one = 5;
make two = -10;
make three = one-two;
print three; #c = 15

make first = -5;
make second = -10;
print first - second; #should print 5;

make d = 100;
make e = 20;
make f = d%e;
print f; #c = 0 should print 0 since there 100/20 has no remainder
